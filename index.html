				<p>As you grow your business, there's one thing that can't be left out of the picture. <span id="people">People.</span>  They're what keeps your business running and keeping them in the scope of your business means personalized communication. <br>

					This is where <span id="people">email</span> comes into the picture.  From coding custom templates specifically for your business to building automated campaigns that <span id="people">connect</span> you with your audience with the right message at the right time, email is the best way to inform, educate, and grow with your customers.</p>

				<h2>About Me <span id="pipe">|</span> Why Email?</h2>
				<p>Working in an agency, you quickly learn the importance of clear and concise communication.  However, for some reason this emphasis is often lost outside of the agency realm, and businesses fail to communicate effectively with their customers.<br>
					<br>
					<span style="color: #0090ff;">Email development combines the importance of clear communication with my love for pure coding creation.</span><br><br>
					I'm also an efficiency geek.  I'm <em>that</em> person who analyzes the internal operations in restaurants while I wait for my food.  While it might make for a bad date, it makes for good business.<br><br>
